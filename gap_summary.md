# Gap Assessment Report

## Executive Summary

Based on your goal of understanding how this project works, the analysis reveals you have good familiarity with the CLI framework (click) but need deeper understanding of the code analysis components (AST), async AI clients, and rich console output patterns. Your learning should focus on the core technical analysis workflow rather than peripheral utilities.

## Project Technologies

- click (CLI framework with @option, @command decorators)
- rich (console formatting with Table, Panel, ROUNDED styles)
- ast (Abstract Syntax Tree parsing with walk, parse, Name, Import nodes)
- openai (AsyncOpenAI client for AI operations)
- dotenv (environment variable loading with load_dotenv)
- Custom modules (stage1_processor, stage2_processor, analyzer, reporter)

## Gap Analysis Results

### ðŸ”´ AST Code Analysis [HIGH Priority]

**Current Level:** Basic recognition of ast.parse function | **Required Level:** Understanding of AST traversal and node analysis for code introspection

**Gap:** You recognize ast.parse is used but need to understand how the project traverses AST nodes (Name, Import, ImportFrom) to analyze code structure and dependencies

**Action Plan:** Study the analyzer.py file to see how ast.walk traverses nodes. Practice with Python's ast module documentation and build a simple dependency analyzer that identifies imported packages from source code.

---

### ðŸ”´ Async AI Client Integration [HIGH Priority]

**Current Level:** Awareness of AsyncOpenAI usage | **Required Level:** Understanding of async/await patterns and AI client integration architecture

**Gap:** You know AsyncOpenAI is used but need to understand the async/await patterns and how AI clients are integrated into the processing pipeline

**Action Plan:** Examine how stage1_processor and stage2_processor use AsyncOpenAI. Learn Python async/await fundamentals and implement a simple async client that processes code analysis results through OpenAI's API.

---

### ðŸŸ¡ Rich Console Output Patterns [MEDIUM Priority]

**Current Level:** Knowledge of Table class usage | **Required Level:** Understanding of rich formatting patterns for reporting and user interaction

**Gap:** You recognize Table usage but need to understand the complete rich implementation including Panel, Text, and console formatting for user feedback and reporting

**Action Plan:** Analyze the reporter.py and tech_stack_questionnaire.py files to see how rich.Table, rich.Panel, and rich.Console create interactive outputs. Build a simple diagnostic tool that uses rich to display formatted code analysis results.

---

### ðŸŸ¡ Project Architecture & Custom Modules [MEDIUM Priority]

**Current Level:** Awareness of custom module existence | **Required Level:** Understanding of the multi-stage processing pipeline architecture

**Gap:** You know custom modules exist but need to understand how stage1_processor, stage2_processor, analyzer, and reporter work together in the processing pipeline

**Action Plan:** Trace the execution flow from CLI command through stage1 â†’ stage2 â†’ analyzer â†’ reporter. Create a diagram mapping how data flows between these components and what each stage contributes to the final output.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ CLI Architecture with Click [LOW Priority]

**Current Level:** Good understanding of @option decorator usage | **Required Level:** Complete understanding of Click command structure and argument handling

**Gap:** You have solid Click knowledge but should understand the complete command group structure and Path argument handling in the CLI

**Action Plan:** Review vibehacks/cli.py to see the @group, @command, and @argument patterns. Create a simple CLI tool that mimics this structure for code analysis tasks.
